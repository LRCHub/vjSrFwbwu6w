The world doesn't follow the rules
Of your stupid fucking card game Zach
Get used to it

I'm a small rouge with no self control
A chaotic neutral who can't find a home
And you've got people lining up at your door
A bard with a guitar and a boy with a sour boards

And you can throw monster after monster at me
And i'll take out my rapier and i'll start swinging
I'm the runt of the litter, i'm the shit of crew
But you don't remember that i'll stick my neck out for you

I mean the campaign
The campaign of course

I was an npc and you were the dm
And it all comes down to the fact that this was never meant to happen
When you told me that you didn't love
Me like I loved you it was a critical hit

And I wish that you could see that i'm stuck
In home brew campaign I promised I wouldn't leave
And you really are trying to get me
To stay but we both know that this, won't end the same way
How do I get you to stop rolling the
Dice, on what could work out here for us?
And, where do I find the potions to
Stop making me feel like i'm not enough?

I was an npc and you were the dm
And it all comes down to the fact that this was never meant to happen
When I told you I loved you and you said
You didn't love me it was a critical hit

A critical hit
It was a critical hit
It was a critical hit
I'm hoping to roll a twenty
I'm hoping to roll a twenty
I'm hoping to roll a twenty
Goddamn it's a one
