I've been living my whole life
Proving to be somebody
Buried in a crowd
Did you know?
You've been there for a while
It's not helping anyone

If you don't take an action standing there
And not be able to raise your only voice
It is the same as not existing at all
Inside this whole universe

So if you are here
Holding to this tiny hands
You gotta be a big tree that can lean on
You gotta be the guiding light of the way
Shine on forever

I just need you by my side
Those are words for those who has become somebody
If not you are just a fallen tree
You're just in the way like a wall

If you don't take an action standing there
And not be able to raise your only voice
It is the same as not existing at all
Inside this whole
This whole universe

So if you are here
Holding to this tiny hands
You gotta be a big tree that can lean on
You gotta be the guiding light of the way

Shine on ahead
It only makes me feel so good
I hope a piece will remain
